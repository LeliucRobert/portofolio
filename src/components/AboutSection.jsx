        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Robert, and I am a passionate enthusiast of computer
          science and technology. I have experience with technologies such as
          C++, Python, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve worked with frameworks like
          Django REST, Flask, and FastAPI. I am well-versed in concepts like
          object-oriented programming, data structures, and operating systems,
          and I know how to effectively work with REST APIs.
        </p>

          One of my most remarkable projects was the AI Microorganism
          Identification, which earned me 2nd place at the Science and
          Technology National Contest. This achievement also led to our
          selection by Milset Romania to participate in Expo Sciences Asia in
          Dubai 2022. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in computer
          science, constantly seeking new opportunities to learn.

          I have developed innovative solutions, ranging from Chrome extensions
          to Websites, all designed to help others. With a particular interest
          in AI, I enjoy exploring ways to automate aspects of my life with it.
          I look forward to connecting with others to collaborate on innovative
          projects and drive technological advancement together.
